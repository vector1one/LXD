some troubleshooting and configs to make contrainers talk out
issue: ubtu 22.04 with apache2 cant get throught with lxc port forward 

IP tables
iptables -I INPUT -j ACCEPT


UFW
allow http
allow ssh
allow 8443


ipv6
the following lines in /etc/sysctrl.conf
 net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
 net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
 net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1


grub
nano /etc/default/grub
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="ipv6.disable=1"
update-grub


LXC
looks like the portforward need to be made on the node you need to fwrd too
ex
port forward on node2 needs to be made on node2 ui
